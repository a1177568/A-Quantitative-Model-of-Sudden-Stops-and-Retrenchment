    ", the optimal share of risky assets is first established for each element in the feasible choice of risk-free assets. Following this, the endogenous grid method is utilized to compute the endogenous grids $m$ for $c$. In my scenario, if the objective is to ascertain the optimal level $B'$ for every $A'$, it's necessary to employ the condition as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "0=\\mathbb{E}t \\big[u'\\big(C_{t+1}(\\text{Regime}_{t+1}, A_{t+1}, B_{t+1})\\big)(\\frac{\\delta+(1-\\delta)q(\\text{Regime}_{t+1},A_{t+1},B_{t+1})}{q(\\text{Regime}_{t},A_t, B_t)}-R_f)\\big]+\\text{Lagrangian Multipliers}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation involves the pair $(A_t, B_t)$. Would this suggest that for every set of states $(\\text{Regime}_t, A_t, B_t)$, an optimal $B_{t+1}^*$ needs to be found corresponding to each potential $A_{t+1}$? If this is the case, I'm still uncertain how to apply the one-dimensional endogenous grid method to resolve for the endogenous grids of $A_t$ and $B_t$ in the subsequent step, given that a single equation is incapable of backing up both $A_t$ and $B_t$."
