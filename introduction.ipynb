    "# Note for A Quantitative Model of Sudden Stops and Retrenchment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Author: Mingzuo Sun (as of June 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "This study explores an Emerging Market (EM) strategy of issuing risky long-term bonds to maintain consumption and risk-free bonds to withstand the global financial cycle. The global financial cycle is modeled as a regime-switching process, including the normal and sudden-stop regimes. Normally, risk-averse foreign financiers buy long-term EM bonds at reasonable prices. However, financiers are forced to sell EM bonds during sudden stops, enabling EM residents to repurchase long-term bonds at significantly lower prices by easing their risk-free bonds. Our model highlights EM's adaptability to global financial changes via two-way capital flows.\n"

The former, issued at time $t$, guarantees $\\delta(1-\\delta)^{j-1}$ units of goods at $t+j$ indefinitely, while the latter guarantees one unit of goods at $t+1$. The one-period bond's price is $\\frac{1}{R_f}$, where $R_f$ is the global risk-free rate, and the long-term bond's price, $q_t$, is endogenous, as we will discuss later."
